1. *Structure-Function decoupling of electrophysiological brain activity during video-watching* :
    The relationship between brain structure and brain activity has previously been investigated by comparing functional connectivity at rest and anatomical connectivity. Naturalistic stimuli enable the study of brain activity dynamics in a more ecological setting, using methods from functional connectivity. In this work, we investigate structure-function relationship during video watching using EEG and MRI data from Healthy Brain Network. In particular, we quantify structure-function decoupling during short periods of time corresponding to highly correlated brain activity across subjects watching the same movie.\
    More details coming soon !!
