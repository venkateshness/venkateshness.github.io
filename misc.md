<h1> Collection of unassorted things </h1>

## Books 

Read:
* **The Power of Subconsious Mind, Joseph Murphy, 1963** - Read in 2017; unsolicited intro to 'Self', catalyst of a role during confinement, led me to hunt more.

* **Astrophysics for People in a Hurry, Neil deGrasse Tyson, 2017** - Gem of 244 pages; amazing narration

* **The Mind's I, Daniel Dennett and Douglas Hofstadter, 1961** - Most chapters are thoroughly enjoyable, took sometime to get absorbed by the ever-changing premises
* **Contact, Carl Sagan, 1985** - The amazing narration made it easier to construct the world mentally. Not sure I would say I loved the ending.
