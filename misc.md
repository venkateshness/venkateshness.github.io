<h1> Collection of unassorted things </h1>

## Books 
Read (sorted chronologically as read):
* *The Power of Subconsious Mind, Joseph Murphy, 1963* - Read in 2017; unsolicited intro to 'Self', catalyst of a role during confinement in 2020, led me to hunt more.
* *The New Mind Readers: What Neuroimaging Can and Cannot Reveal About Our Thoughts, Russell Poldrack, 2018* - Great ride into the world of Neuroimaging research
* *Astrophysics for People in a Hurry, Neil deGrasse Tyson, 2017* - Gem of 244 pages; eloquent narration
* *I Am a Strange Loop, Douglas Hofstadter, 2007* - Shook my world, life-changing, lingering-effect daily. Terrific experience.
* *The Mind's I, Daniel Dennett and Douglas Hofstadter, 1981* - Most chapters are such a pleasure to read and ponder, took sometime to get absorbed by the ever-changing premises
* *Contact, Carl Sagan, 1985* - The amazing narration made it easier to construct the world mentally. Not sure I would say I loved the ending, but solid overall.
* *The Alchemist, Paulo Coelho, 1988* - Mixed feeling
