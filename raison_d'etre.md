## The raison(s) d'Ãªtre

1. Humans have historically been explorers; from looking into the dark starry sky with tiny telescopes & figuring out the sun being the hosting star, to placing the ingenious and astonishing James-Webb Space Telescope looking further back in time, we have always been intrigued by: How it all came to be ?. It discomforts me : How do we know more about the cosmos authored by the brain/mind, than knowing about the author in the first place ?

2. Even though the necessary ingredients go into making a person a person does not vary much between people, everyone is pretty unique -- driven by rich experiences, perception and so on. I wonder if there is at all a point of divergence ?

3. Not being completely dismissive of the (other) idea(s) of Philosophy of Mind philosophically; I am more intrigued by the physical phenomenon that gives rise to the emergence of consciousness via the biological neural networks. I wonder would there be quantifiable consciousness levels with the scientifically rigorous methods ?


To realize the mentioned:
During my PhD, it is envisioned to study with Multimodal Neuroimaging data as it provides access to complementary understanding in space and time. Besides, I use Graph Signal Processing[^1], coupled with Deep Learning to shed more lights in a data-driven and/or hypothesis-driven way.
