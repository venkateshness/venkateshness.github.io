## Short Bio
A data science fellow by formal training, a Cognitive Neuroscience aficionado by fervour, doing research at the converging frontier of Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence, to answer wide range of outstanding/incompletely answered questions relating to **Consciousness**.

My PhD contributes to understanding more about the rise of consciousness through biological neural networks,
by leveraging Multimodal Neuroimaging -- Electroencephalogram (EEG), Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI) -- Deep Learning and Graph Signal Processing.

## Interests
My academic interests and some of my personal interests fuse at several areas: 
* Consciousness
* Artificial Intelligence
* Psychology (Mostly Perceptual and Behavioral)
* Philosophy of Mind
